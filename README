Explode
=======

Expands links to shortened URLs, like TinyURL, bit.ly, etc. using the
LongURL service (longurl.org). Operates in the background without
altering the text or style of anchors — you won’t see it working, but
it’s there! The cache of expanded URLs may be viewed or cleared in the
options page.
